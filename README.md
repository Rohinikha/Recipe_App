# Recipe_App
This is a simple web application for browsing and discovering recipes. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve recipe data from an external API. Users can search for recipes by keyword and view detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.
